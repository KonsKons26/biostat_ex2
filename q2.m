% A company of medical equipment sells three types of analyzers and is interested to
% find out if the type of analyzer sold has an effect on whether a sale is made, as
% well as what time of day the sale is made. The following table records the sales in
% hundreds of Euros of 36 companyâ€™s representatives divided by the type of analyzer
% and by the time of day
